# GitHub Actions CI Fix

## Overview

Use this skill when the task is specifically about failing GitHub Actions checks on a pull request. This workflow is hybrid by design:

- Use the GitHub app from this plugin for PR metadata, changed files, and review context.
- Use `gh` for GitHub Actions checks and logs because the connector does not expose that workflow end to end.
- Summarize the root cause first, propose a focused fix plan, and implement only after explicit approval.

Prereq: authenticate with GitHub CLI once, then confirm with `gh auth status`. Repo and workflow scopes are typically required for Actions inspection.

## Inputs

- `repo`: path inside the repo (default `.`)
- `pr`: PR number or URL (optional; defaults to current branch PR)
- `gh` authentication for the repo host

## Quick start

- `python "<path-to-skill>/scripts/inspect_pr_checks.py" --repo "." --pr "<number-or-url>"`
- Add `--json` if you want machine-friendly output for summarization.

## Workflow

1. Verify gh authentication.
   - Run `gh auth status` in the repo.
   - If unauthenticated, ask the user to run `gh auth login` (ensuring repo + workflow scopes) before proceeding.
2. Resolve the PR.
   - If the user provides a PR number or URL, use that directly.
   - Otherwise prefer the current branch PR with `gh pr view --json number,url`.
   - When repo and PR are known, fetch PR metadata and patch context through the GitHub app from this plugin.
3. Inspect failing checks (GitHub Actions only).
   - Preferred: run the bundled script (handles gh field drift and job-log fallbacks):
     - `python "<path-to-skill>/scripts/inspect_pr_checks.py" --repo "." --pr "<number-or-url>"`
     - Add `--json` for machine-friendly output.
   - Manual fallback:
     - `gh pr checks <pr> --json name,state,bucket,link,startedAt,completedAt,workflow`
       - If a field is rejected, rerun with the available fields reported by `gh`.
     - For each failing check, extract the run id from `detailsUrl` and run:
       - `gh run view <run_id> --json name,workflowName,conclusion,status,url,event,headBranch,headSha`
       - `gh run view <run_id> --log`
     - If the run log says it is still in progress, fetch job logs directly:
       - `gh api "/repos/<owner>/<repo>/actions/jobs/<job_id>/logs" > "<path>"`
4. Scope non-GitHub Actions checks.
   - If `detailsUrl` is not a GitHub Actions run, label it as external and only report the URL.
   - Do not attempt Buildkite or other providers; keep the workflow lean.
5. Summarize failures for the user.
   - Provide the failing check name, run URL (if any), and a concise log snippet.
   - Call out missing logs explicitly and do not over-claim certainty.
6. Propose a focused fix plan and wait for approval.
   - Keep the plan tied directly to the failing checks and the observed root cause.
7. Implement after approval.
   - Apply the approved fix locally.
   - Run the most relevant local verification available.
8. Recheck status and summarize residual risk.
   - Suggest re-running the relevant tests and `gh pr checks`.
   - Report what is still unverified, what may still be flaky, and whether any failing checks were external and therefore not actionable here.

## Bundled Resources

### scripts/inspect_pr_checks.py

Fetch failing PR checks, pull GitHub Actions logs, and extract a failure snippet. Exits non-zero when failures remain so it can be used in automation.

Usage examples:
- `python "<path-to-skill>/scripts/inspect_pr_checks.py" --repo "." --pr "123"`
- `python "<path-to-skill>/scripts/inspect_pr_checks.py" --repo "." --pr "https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123" --json`
- `python "<path-to-skill>/scripts/inspect_pr_checks.py" --repo "." --max-lines 200 --context 40`

## Guardrails

- Do not imply that the GitHub app can replace `gh` for Actions log retrieval.
- Treat non-GitHub Actions providers as report-only unless the user explicitly wants a separate investigation path.
- If the failure is clearly unrelated to the local diff, say so before proposing code changes.
