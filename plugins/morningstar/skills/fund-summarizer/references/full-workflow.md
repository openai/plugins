# Fund Summary Skill

A skill for generating a fund summary or self-contained HTML report with Morningstar insights into a given fund. This skill uses Morningstar MCP tools as the only data source.

> Guardrails are defined in `SKILL.md` and the same apply here.

## Formatting Rules

| Value type | Rule |
|---|---|
| Percentages and ratios | 2 decimal places (e.g. `8.23%`, `1.05`) |
| Category ranks, MPRS | Whole number (e.g. `47`, `82`) |
| Currency amounts | Raw number with commas, no symbol (e.g. `1,234.56`) |
| Large AUM / flows | B/M compact, no symbol (e.g. `1.23B`, `456.70M`) |
| Dates | YYYY-MM-DD |
| Missing numeric | `--` |
| Missing text | `N/A` |

## Workflow

1. **Resolve** the fund from ticker, name, or Morningstar identifier using `morningstar_id_lookup_tool`. Ask only if the match is ambiguous.
2. **Retrieve all fund data in parallel batches.** Fire these as simultaneously as possible — do not wait for one group before starting the next:
   - **Batch A — Core metadata + IP**: all IDs from Core Metadata and Morningstar IP sections in one call to `morningstar_data_tool`
   - **Batch B — Performance, risk + monthly returns**: all performance/risk IDs (including HP010 trailing 10 years) in one call; split into two calls only if the response is truncated
   - **Batch C — Holdings**: all holdings IDs in one `morningstar_data_tool` call
   - **Batch D — Analyst research**: `morningstar_analyst_research_tool` (one call)
   - **Batch E — Holdings list**: `morningstar_fund_holdings_tool` (one call)
   - **Retries**: if a call returns a tool error (not empty data), retry that call once before treating the data as unavailable.
3. **Retrieve benchmark data** as soon as Batch A returns (you only need OF00P from it — do not wait for B–E to finish). Fire one `morningstar_data_tool` call for the benchmark ID: base currency (LS05M), HP010 monthly returns (trailing 10 years), and trailing/annual returns (PD00B, PD00D, PD014, PD00F, PD00H, PM494, HS803, RR015/016/017). Retry once on tool error.
4. **Deliver output** — Markdown by default; create self-contained HTML only if the user explicitly asks. See the two output workflows below.

## Datapoint Map

Batch as many datapoint IDs as possible into a single `morningstar_data_tool` call. Only split across multiple calls if the response is actually truncated — do not pre-emptively chunk.

### Morningstar IP
| Datapoint | ID |
|---|---|
| Medalist Rating | MMR01 |
| Medalist Rating Disclosures Type | CNAXS |
| Morningstar Rating Overall | RR01Y |
| Portfolio Risk Score | QFR0H |
| Analyst Driven % | MMR04 |

### Benchmark Data
Retrieve using the Primary Prospectus Benchmark ID (datapoint: OF00P).

| Datapoint | ID | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Base Currency | LS05M | Pass as `BENCHMARK_CURRENCY`; renderer computes the currency gate automatically |
| Yearly Return | HS803 | Timeseries |
| Monthly Return | HP010 | Timeseries; pass as benchmark values in `MONTHLY_RETURNS_JSON` |
| Total Ret (Daily) YTD / 1/2/3/5/10 Yr | PD00B, PD00D, PD014, PD00F, PD00H, PM494 | |
| Std Dev 3/5/10 Yr (Mo-End) | RR015, RR016, RR017 | Only std dev; do not retrieve benchmark Sharpe, alpha, beta, or R-squared since these are already benchmark relative. |

**Benchmark Currency Gate**: pass `BENCHMARK_CURRENCY` (the benchmark's LS05M value) in the data package. The renderer compares it to `BASE_CURRENCY`, sets `BENCHMARK_CURRENCY_MISMATCH`, and auto-generates `BENCHMARK_LEGEND_ENTRY` and `BENCHMARK_CURRENCY_NOTE`. Your only responsibility: if the two currencies differ, omit Benchmark and Excess rows from `TRAILING_RETURNS_ROWS` and `ANNUAL_RETURNS_ROWS`. Do not null benchmark scalar values — just omit the rows.

## Output Workflow A — Markdown (default)

Use when the user has not explicitly requested an HTML report.

Apply the Formatting Rules table above to all displayed values. Mirror the structure and section depth of the HTML report, using Markdown headers, bold labels, horizontal rules, and tables so the output renders richly inline in chat.

Present in this order:

---
*AI-generated analysis using Morningstar data. For informational purposes only — not investment advice.*

---

### 1. Fund Snapshot
Two-column key/value table: name, ticker, category, investment type, active/passive, inception date, benchmark, AUM, expense ratio, fee level, NAV, yield. Highlight closed-to-new-investors status in bold if applicable.

### 2. Ratings
Present as a compact table with columns: **Medalist Rating**, **Star Rating**, **MPRS**, and analyst-driven %. Follow with a **Pillar Ratings** sub-table (Process / People / Parent / Price). Then quote the analyst summary in a blockquote if available.

### 3. Performance
**Trailing Returns** (`unit` value as column header, e.g. `% Total Return`): table with periods as rows and Fund / Benchmark / Excess as columns. Excess = fund − benchmark; show `--` if benchmark currency differs from fund currency.

**Calendar-Year Returns**: table with years as columns and Fund / Benchmark / Cat Rank as rows. Show `--` if benchmark currency differs from fund currency.

### 4. Risk
**Capture Ratios**: table — periods (1/3/5/10 yr) as columns, Upside Capture / Downside Capture as rows.

**Risk Statistics**: table — periods as columns, Std Dev / Sharpe / Alpha / Beta / R-Squared as rows (fund vs. benchmark std dev where applicable).

### 5. Portfolio
**Asset Allocation**: small table — Equity / Bond / Cash / Other with % values.

**Top 10 Holdings**: ranked table — Holding / Weight (%).

**Style & Exposure** (if available): style box description in text (e.g. "Large-Cap Blend"), followed by compact region-exposure table and market-cap breakdown table.

**Equity Stats** (if available): P/E, P/B, P/S, dividend yield %, sales growth %, cash-flow growth %, average market cap, financial health grade, growth grade, cash return % — presented as a two-column key/value table. Only include rows with available data.

### 6. Fees, Flows & Operations
Table: expense ratio, fee level, turnover. Then flows table: 1M / 3M / 1Y. Then manager block: name, start date (longest-tenured only), ownership level for each manager. Flag closed to new investors if applicable.

---
*Data as of `DATA_AS_OF_DATE`. Report generated `REPORT_DATE`.*

---

For narrow questions, answer only the requested section or metric.

## Output Workflow B — HTML Report (explicit request only)

Use when the user explicitly asks for an HTML report, a self-contained file, or similar.

Assemble a flat data package and pass to the renderer. **The model is responsible for formatting all scalar values and building all HTML row strings.** The renderer only handles assets that require filesystem I/O (logo, icons) and SVG charts that require math (Growth of $10k line chart, allocation donut). Everything else must be set by the model before calling render_report.

### Worked example — minimal complete data package

Build this dict in memory from MCP responses, then pass directly to `render_report`. Do not write intermediate JSON files or helper scripts — assemble the dict inline and call `render_report` once.

from render import render_report
render_report(data, output_path="{TICKER}-fund-summary.html")
```

After `render_report` completes, render the output file as an inline HTML artifact so the user can see it immediately. Do not just report the file path.

Every key shown above must be set. Replace the sample values with actual MCP data. Do not write a builder script — assemble `data` inline and call `render_report` once.

**Renderer-only — do not set these manually:** `RETURNS_CHART_SVG` (AUTO from `MONTHLY_RETURNS_JSON`), `DONUT_CHART_SVG` (AUTO from `ASSET_ALLOCATION_JSON`), `BENCHMARK_CURRENCY_MISMATCH`, `BENCHMARK_LEGEND_ENTRY`, `BENCHMARK_CURRENCY_NOTE` (AUTO from `BASE_CURRENCY` and `BENCHMARK_CURRENCY`), `STAR_RATING_DISPLAY`, `STAR_RATING_ICON`, `MPRS_VISUAL`, `*_ICON`, `*_SCORE_SCALE`, `PRICE_SCORE`, `MEDALIST_DISCLOSURE_TYPE_DISPLAY`, `MEDALIST_DISCLOSURE_FOOTNOTE`, `LOGO_BASE64`. If chart data is genuinely unavailable, set the placeholder to `""` — never a prose message string.

**Before rendering:** every `*_SECTION_CLASS` must be `""` or `"is-empty"`; every `*_SECTION_NOTE` and `*_HEADER` must be set (use `""` when empty). Never leave these unset.

## HTML Report Support

Use `scripts/render.py` with `assets/template.html` and `assets/icons/`. The renderer embeds the logo, selects icon SVGs, builds the Growth of $10k and allocation charts, substitutes all `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` tokens, and writes the output file. All other content must be provided by the model in the data package.

CLI: `python <skill-dir>/scripts/render.py --data data.json --output <ticker>-fund-summary.html`

Output file is written to the current working directory as `{TICKER}-fund-summary.html`. After writing, render it as an inline HTML artifact.

## Quality Checks

- All `--` / `N/A` markers are explicit; no blank cells or unresolved `{{...}}` tokens.
- `REPORT_DATE` = today's date. `DATA_AS_OF_DATE` = PD001 value.
- Active/Index label: non-ETFs use OF00C; ETFs use OF00D.
- `BENCHMARK_CURRENCY_NOTE` non-empty and benchmark rows/chart suppressed when currencies differ.
- File is fully self-contained (no relative asset paths).
