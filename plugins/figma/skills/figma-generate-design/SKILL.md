# Build / Update Screens and Views from Design System

Use this skill to create or update **screens, views, and multi-section UI containers** in Figma by **reusing the published design system** — components, variables, and styles — rather than drawing primitives with hardcoded values. This includes full pages, modals, dialogs, drawers, sidebars, panels, and any composed view with multiple sections. The key insight: the Figma file likely has a published design system with components, color/spacing variables, and text/effect styles that correspond to the codebase's UI components and tokens. Find and use those instead of drawing boxes with hex colors.

**MANDATORY**: You MUST also load [figma-use](../figma-use/SKILL.md) before any `use_figma` call. That skill contains critical rules (color ranges, font loading, etc.) that apply to every script you write.

**Always pass `skillNames: "figma-generate-design"` when calling `use_figma` as part of this skill.** This is a logging parameter — it does not affect execution.

## Skill Boundaries

- Use this skill when the deliverable is a **composed Figma view** (new or updated) — full-page screens, modals, dialogs, drawers, sidebars, panels, or any multi-section container — built from design system component instances.
- If the user wants to generate **code from a Figma design**, switch to [figma-implement-design](../figma-implement-design/SKILL.md).
- If the user wants to create **new reusable components or variants**, use [figma-use](../figma-use/SKILL.md) directly.
- If the user wants to write **Code Connect mappings**, switch to [figma-code-connect](../figma-code-connect/SKILL.md).

## Prerequisites

- Figma MCP server must be connected
- The target Figma file must have a published design system with components (or access to a team library)
- User should provide either:
  - A Figma file URL / file key to work in
  - Or context about which file to target (the agent can discover pages)
- Source code or description of the screen/view to build/update

## Parallel Workflow with generate_figma_design (Web Apps Only)

When building a screen from a **web app** that can be rendered in a browser, the best results come from running both approaches in parallel:

1. **In parallel:**
   - Start building the screen using this skill's workflow (use_figma + design system components)
   - Run `generate_figma_design` to capture a pixel-perfect screenshot of the running web app
2. **Once both complete:** Update the use_figma output to match the pixel-perfect layout from the `generate_figma_design` capture. The capture provides the exact spacing, sizing, and visual treatment to aim for, while your use_figma output has proper component instances linked to the design system. If the capture contains images, transfer them to your use_figma output by copying `imageHash` values from the capture's image fills (see Step 5 for details).
3. **Once confirmed looking good:** Delete the `generate_figma_design` output — it was only used as a visual reference.

This combines the best of both: `generate_figma_design` gives pixel-perfect layout accuracy, while use_figma gives proper design system component instances that stay linked and updatable.

**This parallel workflow is MANDATORY when the source contains images.** The `use_figma` Plugin API cannot fetch external image URLs — it can only set image fills by copying `imageHash` values from nodes already in the file. `generate_figma_design` rasterizes all visible images into Figma, providing the hashes you need. If you skip the capture when images are present, image frames will be left blank.

For non-web apps (iOS, Android, etc.) or when updating existing screens, use the standard workflow below.

## Required Workflow

**Follow these steps in order. Do not skip steps.**

> **Hard gates — forbidden shortcuts:**
>
> - **Forbidden:** `search_design_system` for component keys until 2a-i is complete and 2a-ii is attempted or logged N/A (e.g. "empty file, no existing screens").
> - **Forbidden:** Any `use_figma` call that mutates the canvas (Step 3+) until all Step 2 rows in the checklist below are filled in.

### Step 1: Understand the Deliverable

Before touching Figma, understand what you're building:

1. If building from code, read the relevant source files to understand the structure, sections, and which components are used.
2. Identify the major sections of the view (e.g., for a page: Header, Hero, Content Panels, Footer; for a modal: Title Bar, Form Sections, Action Bar; for a sidebar: Navigation, Content Area, Footer Actions).
3. For each section, list the UI components involved (buttons, inputs, cards, navigation pills, accordions, etc.).
4. **Check whether the view contains any images** (e.g., `<img>`, `<Image>`, background images, product photos, avatars, icons loaded from URLs). If it does and this is a web app, you **must** run the parallel `generate_figma_design` capture workflow — start it immediately alongside Step 2 so the capture runs while you discover components. See "Parallel Workflow with generate_figma_design" above.

### Step 2: Collect Component Keys, Variables, and Styles

You need three things from the design system: **components** (buttons, cards, etc.), **variables** (colors, spacing, radii), and **styles** (text styles, effect styles like shadows). Don't hardcode hex colors or pixel values when design system tokens exist.

#### 2a: Discover components


**2a-i — REQUIRED: Check Code Connect for needed components.** Starting from the component list you built in Step 1, check whether each component has a Code Connect file in the codebase. Code Connect files live next to the component source and are named by platform:

- **TypeScript/JS**: `*.figma.ts`, `*.figma.js`
- **React (parser-based)**: `*.figma.tsx`
- **Kotlin/Compose**: `.kt` files containing `@FigmaConnect`
- **Swift**: `.swift` files containing `FigmaConnect`

For each component you need (e.g., Button, Card, Input), search for its Code Connect file — glob or grep by component name (e.g., `**/Button.figma.tsx`, `**/Card.figma.ts`). Only read files that match components you actually need.

From each matching Code Connect file, extract the Figma component URL. Parse `fileKey` and `nodeId` from the URL (convert hyphens to colons: `123-456` → `123:456`). Then resolve component keys via `use_figma`:

**Example:** Code Connect file contains `// url=https://figma.com/design/ABC123/File?node-id=609-35535`. Parse `fileKey` = `ABC123`, `nodeId` = `609:35535`. Run `use_figma` against the **library file** (fileKey `ABC123`, not the target file) to resolve the key:

```js
const node = await figma.getNodeByIdAsync("609:35535");
const set = node?.parent?.type === "COMPONENT_SET" ? node.parent : node;
return { componentKey: set.key };
```

Batch multiple lookups in a single call. Use the returned keys with `importComponentSetByKeyAsync()` in Step 4.

Mark resolved components. If all components are resolved, skip 2a-ii and 2a-iii. If none of the needed components have Code Connect files, proceed to 2a-ii.

**2a-ii — REQUIRED if unresolved components remain: Inspect existing screens.** Check if the target file already contains screens using the same design system. A single `use_figma` call that walks an existing frame's instances gives you an exact, authoritative component map:

```js
const frame = figma.currentPage.findOne(n => n.name === "Existing Screen");
const uniqueSets = new Map();
frame.findAll(n => n.type === "INSTANCE").forEach(inst => {
  const mc = inst.mainComponent;
  const cs = mc?.parent?.type === "COMPONENT_SET" ? mc.parent : null;
  const key = cs ? cs.key : mc?.key;
  const name = cs ? cs.name : mc?.name;
  if (key && !uniqueSets.has(key)) {
    uniqueSets.set(key, { name, key, isSet: !!cs, sampleVariant: mc.name });
  }
});
return [...uniqueSets.values()];
```

Match results against your unresolved components. Mark any newly resolved. If all components are resolved, skip 2a-iii.

**2a-iii — LAST RESORT: `search_design_system`.** Only if components remain unresolved after completing both 2a-i and 2a-ii. **Search broadly** — try multiple terms and synonyms (e.g., "button", "input", "nav", "card", "accordion", "header", "footer", "tag", "avatar", "toggle", "icon", etc.). Use `includeComponents: true` to focus on components.

**Include component properties** in your map — you need to know which TEXT properties each component exposes for text overrides. Create a temporary instance, read its `componentProperties` (and those of nested instances), then remove the temp instance.

Example component map with property info:

```
Component Map:
- Button → key: "abc123", type: COMPONENT_SET
  Properties: { "Label#2:0": TEXT, "Has Icon#4:64": BOOLEAN }
- PricingCard → key: "ghi789", type: COMPONENT_SET
  Properties: { "Device": VARIANT, "Variant": VARIANT }
  Nested "Text Heading" has: { "Text#2104:5": TEXT }
  Nested "Button" has: { "Label#2:0": TEXT }
```

#### 2b: Discover variables (colors, spacing, radii)

**Inspect existing screens first** (same as components). Or use `search_design_system` with `includeVariables: true`.

> **WARNING: Two different variable discovery methods — do not confuse them.**
>
> - `use_figma` with `figma.variables.getLocalVariableCollectionsAsync()` — returns **only local variables defined in the current file**. If this returns empty, it does **not** mean no variables exist. Remote/published library variables are invisible to this API.
> - `search_design_system` with `includeVariables: true` — searches across **all linked libraries**, including remote and published ones. This is the correct tool for discovering design system variables.
>
> **Never conclude "no variables exist" based solely on `getLocalVariableCollectionsAsync()` returning empty.** Always also run `search_design_system` with `includeVariables: true` to check for library variables before deciding to create your own.

**Query strategy:** `search_design_system` matches against **variable names** (e.g., "Gray/gray-9", "core/gray/100", "space/400"), not categories. Run multiple short, simple queries in parallel rather than one compound query:

- **Primitive colors:** "gray", "red", "blue", "green", "white", "brand"
- **Semantic colors:** "background", "foreground", "border", "surface", "text"
- **Spacing/sizing:** "space", "radius", "gap", "padding"

If initial searches return empty, try shorter fragments or different naming conventions — libraries vary widely ("grey" vs "gray", "spacing" vs "space", "color/bg" vs "background").

Inspect an existing screen's bound variables for the most authoritative results:

```js
const frame = figma.currentPage.findOne(n => n.name === "Existing Screen");
const varMap = new Map();
frame.findAll(() => true).forEach(node => {
  const bv = node.boundVariables;
  if (!bv) return;
  for (const [prop, binding] of Object.entries(bv)) {
    const bindings = Array.isArray(binding) ? binding : [binding];
    for (const b of bindings) {
      if (b?.id && !varMap.has(b.id)) {
        const v = await figma.variables.getVariableByIdAsync(b.id);
        if (v) varMap.set(b.id, { name: v.name, id: v.id, key: v.key, type: v.resolvedType, remote: v.remote });
      }
    }
  }
});
return [...varMap.values()];
```

For library variables (remote = true), import them by key with `figma.variables.importVariableByKeyAsync(key)`. For local variables, use `figma.variables.getVariableByIdAsync(id)` directly.

See [variable-patterns.md](../figma-use/references/variable-patterns.md) for binding patterns.

#### 2c: Discover styles (text styles, effect styles)

Search for styles using `search_design_system` with `includeStyles: true` and terms like "heading", "body", "shadow", "elevation". Or inspect what an existing screen uses:

```js
const frame = figma.currentPage.findOne(n => n.name === "Existing Screen");
const styles = { text: new Map(), effect: new Map() };
frame.findAll(() => true).forEach(node => {
  if ('textStyleId' in node && node.textStyleId) {
    const s = figma.getStyleById(node.textStyleId);
    if (s) styles.text.set(s.id, { name: s.name, id: s.id, key: s.key });
  }
  if ('effectStyleId' in node && node.effectStyleId) {
    const s = figma.getStyleById(node.effectStyleId);
    if (s) styles.effect.set(s.id, { name: s.name, id: s.id, key: s.key });
  }
});
return {
  textStyles: [...styles.text.values()],
  effectStyles: [...styles.effect.values()]
};
```

Import library styles with `figma.importStyleByKeyAsync(key)`, then apply with `node.textStyleId = style.id` or `node.effectStyleId = style.id`.

See [text-style-patterns.md](../figma-use/references/text-style-patterns.md) and [effect-style-patterns.md](../figma-use/references/effect-style-patterns.md) for details.

### Step 3: Create the Wrapper Frame First

**Do NOT build sections as top-level page children and reparent them later** — moving nodes across `use_figma` calls with `appendChild()` silently fails and produces orphaned frames. Instead, create the wrapper first, then build each section directly inside it.

Create the wrapper in its own `use_figma` call. Position it away from existing content and return its ID:

```js
// Find clear space
let maxX = 0;
for (const child of figma.currentPage.children) {
  maxX = Math.max(maxX, child.x + child.width);
}

const wrapper = figma.createAutoLayout("VERTICAL");

// --- Size the wrapper based on container type ---
// Full page:       wrapper.resize(1440, 100); wrapper.name = "Homepage";
// Modal/dialog:    wrapper.resize(640, 100);  wrapper.name = "Settings Modal";
// Drawer/sidebar:  wrapper.resize(360, 100);  wrapper.name = "Navigation Drawer";
// Panel:           wrapper.resize(400, 100);  wrapper.name = "Details Panel";
// Adapt width to match the source code's actual dimensions.

wrapper.name = "VIEW_NAME";
wrapper.primaryAxisAlignItems = "CENTER";
wrapper.counterAxisAlignItems = "CENTER";
wrapper.resize(WIDTH, 100);
wrapper.layoutSizingHorizontal = "FIXED";
wrapper.x = maxX + 200;
wrapper.y = 0;

return { success: true, wrapperId: wrapper.id };
```

### Step 4: Build Each Section Inside the Wrapper

**This is the most important step.** Build one section at a time, each in its own `use_figma` call. At the start of each script, fetch the wrapper by ID and append new content directly to it.

```js
const createdNodeIds = [];
const wrapper = await figma.getNodeByIdAsync("WRAPPER_ID_FROM_STEP_3");

// Import design system components by key
const buttonSet = await figma.importComponentSetByKeyAsync("BUTTON_SET_KEY");
const primaryButton = buttonSet.children.find(c =>
  c.type === "COMPONENT" && c.name.includes("variant=primary")
) || buttonSet.defaultVariant;

// Import design system variables for colors and spacing
const bgColorVar = await figma.variables.importVariableByKeyAsync("BG_COLOR_VAR_KEY");
const spacingVar = await figma.variables.importVariableByKeyAsync("SPACING_VAR_KEY");

// Build section frame with variable bindings (not hardcoded values)
const section = figma.createAutoLayout();
section.name = "Header";
section.setBoundVariable("paddingLeft", spacingVar);
section.setBoundVariable("paddingRight", spacingVar);
const bgPaint = figma.variables.setBoundVariableForPaint(
  { type: 'SOLID', color: { r: 0, g: 0, b: 0 } }, 'color', bgColorVar
);
section.fills = [bgPaint];

// Import and apply text/effect styles
const shadowStyle = await figma.importStyleByKeyAsync("SHADOW_STYLE_KEY");
section.effectStyleId = shadowStyle.id;

// Create component instances inside the section
const btnInstance = primaryButton.createInstance();
section.appendChild(btnInstance);
createdNodeIds.push(btnInstance.id);

// Append section to wrapper
wrapper.appendChild(section);
section.layoutSizingHorizontal = "FILL"; // AFTER appending

createdNodeIds.push(section.id);
return { success: true, createdNodeIds };
```

After each section, validate with `get_screenshot` before moving on. Look closely for cropped/clipped text (line heights cutting off content) and overlapping elements — these are the most common issues and easy to miss at a glance.

#### Override instance text with setProperties()

Component instances ship with placeholder text ("Title", "Heading", "Button"). Use the component property keys you discovered in Step 2 to override them with `setProperties()` — this is more reliable than direct `node.characters` manipulation. See [component-patterns.md](../figma-use/references/component-patterns.md#overriding-text-in-a-component-instance) for the full pattern.

For nested instances that expose their own TEXT properties, call `setProperties()` on the nested instance:

```js
const nestedHeading = cardInstance.findOne(n => n.type === "INSTANCE" && n.name === "Text Heading");
if (nestedHeading) {
  nestedHeading.setProperties({ "Text#2104:5": "Actual heading from source code" });
}
```

Only fall back to direct `node.characters` for text that is NOT managed by any component property.

#### Read source code defaults carefully

When translating code components to Figma instances, check the component's default prop values in the source code, not just what's explicitly passed. For example, `<Button size="small">Register</Button>` with no variant prop — check the component definition to find `variant = "primary"` as the default. Selecting the wrong variant (e.g., Neutral instead of Primary) produces a visually incorrect result that's easy to miss.

#### What to build manually vs. import from design system

| Build manually | Import from design system |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| Wrapper frame | **Components**: buttons, cards, inputs, nav, etc. |
| Section container frames | **Variables**: colors (fills, strokes), spacing (padding, gap), radii |
| Layout grids (rows, columns) | **Text styles**: heading, body, caption, etc. |
| | **Effect styles**: shadows, blurs, etc. |

**Never hardcode hex colors or pixel spacing** when a design system variable exists. Use `setBoundVariable` for spacing/radii and `setBoundVariableForPaint` for colors. Apply text styles with `node.textStyleId` and effect styles with `node.effectStyleId`.

### Step 5: Validate the Full View and Transfer Images

After composing all sections, call `get_screenshot` on the wrapper frame and compare against the source. Fix any issues with targeted `use_figma` calls — don't rebuild the entire view.

**Screenshot individual sections, not just the full view.** A full-view screenshot at reduced resolution hides text truncation, wrong colors, and placeholder text that hasn't been overridden. Take a screenshot of each section by node ID to catch:
- **Cropped/clipped text** — line heights or frame sizing cutting off descenders, ascenders, or entire lines
- **Overlapping content** — elements stacking on top of each other due to incorrect sizing or missing auto-layout
- Placeholder text still showing ("Title", "Heading", "Button")
- Truncated content from layout sizing bugs
- Wrong component variants (e.g., Neutral vs Primary button)
- **Blank image placeholders** — if images are missing, you need to transfer them from the `generate_figma_design` capture (see below)

#### Transfer images from the generate_figma_design capture

If you ran `generate_figma_design` in parallel (mandatory when the source contains images), transfer the captured images into your design system output:

1. Find all image nodes in the capture output by searching for fills with `type === "IMAGE"`:
   ```js
   const capture = await figma.getNodeByIdAsync("CAPTURE_NODE_ID");
   const imageNodes = [];
   capture.findAll(n => {
     if (n.fills && Array.isArray(n.fills)) {
       for (const fill of n.fills) {
         if (fill.type === "IMAGE") {
           imageNodes.push({ name: n.name, id: n.id, imageHash: fill.imageHash });
           return true;
         }
       }
     }
     return false;
   });
   return imageNodes;
   ```
2. Match each captured image to the corresponding frame in your use_figma output (by position, name, or order).
3. Apply the image hash to the target frame:
   ```js
   targetFrame.fills = [{ type: "IMAGE", imageHash: "hash_from_capture", scaleMode: "FILL" }];
   ```
4. Delete the `generate_figma_design` capture output after all images are transferred.

### Step 6: Updating an Existing View

When updating rather than creating from scratch:

1. Use `get_metadata` to inspect the existing screen structure.
2. Identify which sections need updating and which can stay.
3. For each section that needs changes:
   - Locate the existing nodes by ID or name
   - Swap component instances if the design system component changed
   - Update text content, variant properties, or layout as needed
   - Remove deprecated sections
   - Add new sections
4. Validate with `get_screenshot` after each modification.

```js
// Example: Swap a button variant in an existing screen
const existingButton = await figma.getNodeByIdAsync("EXISTING_BUTTON_INSTANCE_ID");
if (existingButton && existingButton.type === "INSTANCE") {
  // Import the updated component
  const buttonSet = await figma.importComponentSetByKeyAsync("BUTTON_SET_KEY");
  const newVariant = buttonSet.children.find(c =>
    c.name.includes("variant=primary") && c.name.includes("size=lg")
  ) || buttonSet.defaultVariant;
  existingButton.swapComponent(newVariant);
}
return { success: true, mutatedNodeIds: [existingButton.id] };
```

## Reference Docs

For detailed API patterns and gotchas, load these from the [figma-use](../figma-use/SKILL.md) references as needed:

- [component-patterns.md](../figma-use/references/component-patterns.md) — importing by key, finding variants, setProperties, text overrides, working with instances
- [variable-patterns.md](../figma-use/references/variable-patterns.md) — creating/binding variables, importing library variables, scopes, aliasing, discovering existing variables
- [text-style-patterns.md](../figma-use/references/text-style-patterns.md) — creating/applying text styles, importing library text styles, type ramps
- [effect-style-patterns.md](../figma-use/references/effect-style-patterns.md) — creating/applying effect styles (shadows), importing library effect styles
- [gotchas.md](../figma-use/references/gotchas.md) — layout pitfalls (HUG/FILL interactions, counterAxisAlignItems, sizing order), paint/color issues, page context resets

## Error Recovery

Follow the error recovery process from [figma-use](../figma-use/SKILL.md#6-error-recovery--self-correction):

1. **STOP** on error — do not retry immediately.
2. **Read the error message carefully** to understand what went wrong.
3. If the error is unclear, call `get_metadata` or `get_screenshot` to inspect the current file state.
4. **Fix the script** based on the error message.
5. **Retry** the corrected script — this is safe because failed scripts are atomic (nothing is created if a script errors).

Because this skill works incrementally (one section per call), errors are naturally scoped to a single section. Previous sections from successful calls remain intact.

## Best Practices

- **Always search before building.** The design system likely has the component, variable, or style you need. Manual construction and hardcoded values should be the exception, not the rule.
- **Search broadly.** Try synonyms and partial terms. A "NavigationPill" might be found under "pill", "nav", "tab", or "chip". For variables, search "color", "spacing", "radius", etc.
- **Prefer design system tokens over hardcoded values.** Use variable bindings for colors, spacing, and radii. Use text styles for typography. Use effect styles for shadows. This keeps the screen linked to the design system.
- **Prefer component instances over manual builds.** Instances stay linked to the source component and update automatically when the design system evolves.
- **Work section by section.** Never build more than one major section per `use_figma` call.
- **Return node IDs from every call.** You'll need them to compose sections and for error recovery.
- **Validate visually after each section.** Use `get_screenshot` to catch issues early.
- **Match existing conventions.** If the file already has screens, match their naming, sizing, and layout patterns.
